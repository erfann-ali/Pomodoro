Hello Everyone

I have created this timer program called Pomodoro

This program will have two buttom to click which are start and reset

When you click start:
  1. the timer will start counting down from 25 minutes for your work session
  2. When 25 minutes has passed, it will go into 5 minutes break
  3. It will have total of 4 work sessions
  4. Once you are done with 4 work sessions, the timer will go into 20 minutes break wich is longer break time

When you click reset, It will just reset everything.

I created this program while learning tkinter and I hope this program will help me to become better and better in time management.
